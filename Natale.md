Honestly this year is not difficult for me even though I completely changed my life.
Four months ago I didn't even know where I was going to live and study this year and now I'm here doing things I've never done before.
I always saw my father doing programs and html since I was little and I didn't understand anything and now being able to do all these thing is fantastic for me.
I like writing programs about anything I like and make them in any way I like and making them personal.
Obviously we can't learn everything but I like looking for new stuff to make even though sometimes I just would like to scream and delete everything.
I would like to improve more on the styling part but at the same time I feel good at it.
