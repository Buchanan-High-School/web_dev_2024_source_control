# Reflection Of the Year

**what are you enjoying**
- I feel like I am enjoying the fact that I already understand a lot of the things that we have been doing so far and I find it pretty easy.

**What did you not like very much**
- The big thing that I dont like is also what I like, that I find it really easy and that I understand most things already.

**What do you feel good at**
- I feel like im pretty good at making semantic html and not making stupid mistakes in the html or css.

**What do you need to improve on?**
- I need to get better at turning my wok in on time. Although I know what im doing I think that makes me a little bit lazier when I start and finish asignments.
